Changlog next version
---------------------
* Updated Scala module to use Scala 2.9.1
* Updated Groovy module to use Groovy 1.8.5

Changelog 1.3.3
---------------
* Added support for AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, AtomicReference and AtomicBoolean, e.g. await().untilAtomic(atomic, equalTo(2)).

Changelog 1.3.2
---------------
* Fixed an issue where poll interval overrode the poll delay.
* Awaitility now throws IllegalStateException when timeout is less than or equal to the poll interval or poll delay.
* Improved error messages when using field suppliers (e.g. await().until( fieldIn(object).ofType(int.class), is(2) );) when timeout occurs.

Changelog 1.3.1
---------------
* Groovy support! Syntax is: await().until { something() > 5 }
* Improved error messages in Scala DSL.
* Add SPI support for extension DSL:s which allows them to provide error messages.

Changelog 1.3
-------------
* MethodCallRecorder generates an exception on getLastXXX if no method call have been recorded. 
* MethodCallRecorder is reset after retrieving last calls and on Awaitility.reset 
* Added basic support for Scala functions
* Added a fieldIn method to Awaitility which allows you to build a supplier using a field, e.g. await().until(fieldIn(object).ofType(int.class), equalTo(1));
* Backward incompatible refactoring: until(callTo(..)) has been renamed to untilCall(to(..)). This to allow for extension DSL's (such as the Scala DSL) to work appropriately.
* Fixed a bug that failed to set Awaitility to catch uncaught exceptions on reset

Changelog version 1.2.1
-----------------------
* Changed ProxyCreator to use the standard InvocationHandler interface
* Refactored for even better error messsages.

Changelog version 1.2
---------------------
* Improved error messages for timeouts to include actual value.

Changelog version 1.1
---------------------
* Major internal refactoring to allow for better default error messages when a timeout occurs.
* Support for using proxy-based conditions (i.e. using Awaitility.callTo) when testing Eclipse applications.
* Calls to the method Object.finalize should not be recorded as this is part of gc.
